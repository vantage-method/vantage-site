# Vantage Method

> Vantage Method designs and operates agentic marketing systems for businesses. We automate lead generation, measure what matters, and deliver results that fit within operating margins. Based in the US, we serve businesses looking for data-driven marketing that actually works.

## About

Vantage Method is a marketing systems company. We build and operate end-to-end marketing infrastructure — from brand positioning through qualified lead delivery. Our approach is grounded in three principles: Data First, Automate Everything, and Work in Your Sweet Spot.

We offer three core services:

- **Business Analysis & AI Discovery**: Revenue and margin analysis, customer journey mapping, and marketing budget feasibility. We evaluate whether marketing can responsibly accelerate a business and where automation fits.
- **End-to-End Marketing Systems**: Complete marketing systems including website and conversion optimization, paid advertising, email campaigns, and lead qualification and handoff.
- **Marketing for Equity**: For businesses with strong fundamentals but limited capital, we offer a long-term partnership model with full marketing operations in exchange for equity and profit participation.

Pricing is not flat. Every engagement begins with evaluation, and pricing is aligned to feasibility, scope, and expected return. In the right cases, partnership replaces retainers.

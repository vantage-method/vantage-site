            <p><strong>Start with a Strategic Evaluation</strong></p>
            <p>Before we move into execution, we begin with a Strategic Evaluation to ensure marketing can responsibly and effectively accelerate your business — and to confirm that we’re the right fit to build together.</p>
            <p>This evaluation allows us to assess:</p>
            <ul class="pricing-list">
                <li>Revenue, margin, and budget feasibility</li>
                <li>Where your current systems are breaking (and what to fix first)</li>
                <li>A clear roadmap for what to measure, what to automate, and what to build</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="emphasis">This first step ensures our conversations are focused, intentional, and designed to produce real outcomes — not guesswork.</span>
